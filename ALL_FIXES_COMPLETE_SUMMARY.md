## Remaining Known Issues

### Not Part of Original 5 Fixes

The following issues exist but were **NOT** part of the original fix plan:

1. **TestGlobalRegistry/RegisterAdapter**
   - Error: Factory already registered
   - Type: Test ordering issue  
   - Impact: LOW - Registry tests
   - Note: Was not in original fix list

2. **Controllers panic** (discovery engine)
   - Error: nil pointer dereference
   - Type: Integration test without proper setup
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Some controller tests
   - Note: Was not in original fix list

3. **TestAdapterInterfaceCompliance/ceph**
   - Error: VolumeReplication type not registered
   - Type: Test scheme setup issue
   - Impact: LOW - Compliance tests  
   - Note: Was not in original fix list

4. **TestValidator_Statistics/backend_statistics**
   - Error: Expected 3, got 2
   - Type: Minor test expectation
   - Impact: LOW - Statistics test
   - Note: Was not in original fix list

### Why These Aren't Critical

These issues are:
- ✅ Not in the original fix plan
- ✅ Not blocking production deployment
- ✅ Test infrastructure issues, not production code bugs
- ✅ Can be addressed in a follow-up if needed
