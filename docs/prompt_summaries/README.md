# Prompt Implementation Summaries

This directory contains detailed summaries for each implementation prompt from the `Implementation_Prompts.md` file.

## Convention

**File Naming:** `PROMPT_X.Y_SUMMARY.md`
- X.Y corresponds to the prompt number (e.g., 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)

**Location:** All prompt summaries MUST be placed in this directory:
```
unified-replication-operator/docs/prompt_summaries/
```

## Current Summaries

### Phase 3: Backend Foundation
- **PROMPT_3.4_SUMMARY.md** - Adapter Integration Testing
  - Comprehensive adapter testing framework
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Fault tolerance tests
  - Load testing framework

### Phase 4: Controller Implementation
- **PROMPT_4.1_SUMMARY.md** - Controller Foundation
  - Core controller with lifecycle management
  - Finalizer handling
  - Status reporting
  - Basic reconciliation loop

- **PROMPT_4.2_SUMMARY.md** - Engine Integration
  - Discovery engine integration
  - Translation engine integration
  - Dynamic backend selection
  - Performance optimizations (caching)

- **PROMPT_4.3_SUMMARY.md** - Advanced Controller Features
  - State machine validation
  - Retry and backoff strategies
  - Circuit breaker pattern
  - Health and readiness checks
  - Correlation ID tracking

## Summary Contents

Each prompt summary contains:

1. **Overview** - What was implemented
2. **Deliverables** - Specific files and code created
3. **Success Criteria** - How requirements were met
4. **Test Results** - Test coverage and pass rates
5. **Code Statistics** - Lines of code, file counts
6. **Usage Examples** - How to use the implementation
7. **Documentation** - Related docs and guides
8. **Next Steps** - What comes after

## Statistics

| Prompt | Files Created/Enhanced | Lines of Code | Tests | Pass Rate |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| 3.4 | 5 test files | ~2,250 | 25 functions | 100% |
| 4.1 | 5 controller files | ~1,700 | 29 specs | 100% |
| 4.2 | 1 file enhanced, 1 test file | ~1,280 | 11 tests | 100% |
| 4.3 | 4 new files, 1 enhanced | ~1,763 | 32 subtests | 100% |
| **Total** | **15+ files** | **~7,000** | **~97 tests** | **100%** |

## Future Prompts

### Upcoming (Phase 5-6)
- Prompt 5.1: Security and Validation
- Prompt 5.2: Complete Backend Implementation
- Prompt 6.1: Deployment Packaging
- Prompt 6.2: Final Integration and Documentation

**Note:** All future prompt summaries MUST be placed in this directory following the naming convention.

## Verification

To verify all summaries are in place:
```bash
ls -lh docs/prompt_summaries/PROMPT_*.md
```

To count completed prompts:
```bash
ls docs/prompt_summaries/PROMPT_*.md | wc -l
```

To view specific summary:
```bash
cat docs/prompt_summaries/PROMPT_4.3_SUMMARY.md
```

## Quick Reference

### Access Summaries
```bash
# From project root
cd unified-replication-operator/docs/prompt_summaries

# List all summaries
ls -1 PROMPT_*.md

# Search across summaries
grep -r "Success Criteria" .
```

### Summary Template

Each summary should include:
```markdown
# Prompt X.Y: Title - Implementation Summary

## Overview
[Brief description]

## Deliverables
[What was created]

## Success Criteria Achievement
✅ Criterion 1
✅ Criterion 2
...

## Test Results
[Pass rates and coverage]

## Code Statistics
[Lines, files, tests]

## Conclusion
[Final status and next steps]
```

## Integration with Development

These summaries serve as:
- **Progress Tracking** - See what's been completed
- **Reference Documentation** - Understand implementation details
- **Testing Evidence** - Verify quality and coverage
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Onboard new developers
- **Audit Trail** - Track decision-making

## Maintainers

When implementing new prompts:
1. Create `PROMPT_X.Y_SUMMARY.md` in this directory
2. Follow the established template
3. Include all required sections
4. Update this README with the new entry
5. Commit summary with the implementation code
